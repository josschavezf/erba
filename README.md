## Description

In prokaryotes, transcriptional regulation is mainly orchestrated by three types of regulators: transcription factors, sigma factors, and riboswitches. The package erba provides functions integrated into a complete workflow that allows describing the evolutionary relationship between transcriptional regulatory elements and the branches of evolution in bacteria and archaea.
